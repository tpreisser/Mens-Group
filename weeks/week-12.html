        <li>God's answer to "Who am I?" was simply "I will be with you." Why wasn't God interested in listing Moses' qualifications?</li>
        <li>Moses had multiple objections—identity, authority, credibility, ability. Which of those do you tend to hide behind?</li>
        <li>Moses finally just said "Please send someone else." When have you tried to talk your way out of something you knew you were supposed to do?</li>
        <li>Moses was 80 years old and had been a shepherd for 40 years when God called him. What does that say about the timeline of being ready?</li>
