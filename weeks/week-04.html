        <li>The older brother had been keeping score for years—what he did right, what he never got. What's on your mental ledger?</li>
        <li>He said "this son of yours" instead of "my brother." When have you distanced yourself from someone because of resentment?</li>
        <li>The father said "all that is mine is yours"—the older son already had access to everything. He just never took it. Where might you be grinding for something that's already available?</li>
        <li>The older brother ended up outside the party by choice. Bitterness kept him out, not the father. What does resentment actually cost you over time?</li>
        <li>What would it take to put down the ledger?</li>
