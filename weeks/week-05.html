        <li>Sanballat and Tobiah mocked the work before it even got started. Who or what has tried to discourage you before you could even begin?</li>
        <li>Nehemiah's response to mockery was "so we built the wall." He didn't argue, he worked. When is engaging with critics the wrong move?</li>
        <li>They built with a tool in one hand and a weapon in the other. What does it look like to build while staying guarded against real threats?</li>
        <li>The enemies tried to get Nehemiah to "come down" for a meeting—to pull him off the work with something that seemed reasonable. What distractions disguise themselves as opportunities in your life?</li>
        <li>"I am doing a great work and I cannot come down." What would you need to believe about what you're building to say that?</li>
