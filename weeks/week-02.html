        <li>Jacob's name meant "deceiver" and he lived up to it. What labels—from your family, your past, your own head—have shaped how you operate?</li>
        <li>God made Jacob say his own name out loud before renaming him. Why would owning who you've been be the first step to becoming someone different?</li>
        <li>Jacob had been running and scheming for 20 years. It took being alone with nowhere to go for this to happen. When has being cornered led to a breakthrough for you?</li>
        <li>Jacob got a new name but walked away with a permanent limp. What does it mean that real transformation left a mark on him?</li>
        <li>What's the difference between wanting to change and actually wrestling with God over it?</li>
