        <li>Naaman was powerful and respected—but he had something destroying him slowly that he couldn't fix. What's the thing in your life that success can't touch?</li>
        <li>Naaman had a whole picture in his head of how this was supposed to go. When has your expectation of how God should work gotten in the way of what He was actually doing?</li>
        <li>Naaman would have done something hard. He resisted something simple. Why is humble obedience sometimes harder for men than difficult achievement?</li>
        <li>It took his servants—people beneath him—to talk sense into him. Who in your life speaks truth to you that you're tempted to dismiss?</li>
        <li>Naaman dipped seven times, not once. What does repeated, unglamorous obedience build that one dramatic moment doesn't?</li>
