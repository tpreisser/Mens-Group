        <li>Solomon held nothing back—"whatever my eyes desired, I did not keep from them." And he still called it meaningless. What are you chasing that you assume will satisfy you?</li>
        <li>He says he "hated life" even though he achieved everything. What does that tell you about the relationship between success and fulfillment?</li>
        <li>Solomon writes that the wise man dies just like the fool—death levels everything. How does ignoring mortality affect the way men pursue things?</li>
        <li>"All is vanity and a striving after wind." Have you ever achieved something and felt the emptiness of it? What was that like?</li>
        <li>The book isn't hopeless—it ends with "Fear God and keep his commandments." What do you think Solomon learned about what actually lasts?</li>
