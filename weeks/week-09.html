        <li>Joseph did everything right and still ended up in prison for years. When has obedience not led to the outcome you expected?</li>
        <li>The cupbearer forgot Joseph for two full years. What does it feel like to be forgotten by someone who could've helped you?</li>
        <li>In every situation—slavery, prison—Joseph was faithful and rose to responsibility. What does it look like to be excellent in a season that feels like it doesn't matter?</li>
        <li>Joseph was 17 when he was sold and 30 when he stood before Pharaoh. How do you keep going when the timeline doesn't match your expectations?</li>
        <li>What's your "chapter that looks like nothing"? What would faithfulness look like in it right now?</li>
