        <li>Jonah was angry that his enemies received mercy. When have you been frustrated that someone got grace you didn't think they deserved?</li>
        <li>God asks Jonah twice: "Do you do well to be angry?" What would it look like to honestly ask yourself that question when you're heated?</li>
        <li>Jonah cared more about a plant that gave him shade than about 120,000 people. What does that reveal about how comfort can distort our priorities?</li>
        <li>The book ends with God's question unanswered. Why do you think the story ends without resolution?</li>
        <li>What's something that sets you off that might be revealing something deeper underneath?</li>
