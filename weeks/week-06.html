        <li>Jonathan gave David his robe, armor, and weapons—the symbols of his own position. What does it cost to genuinely celebrate someone else's success?</li>
        <li>Jonathan was caught between loyalty to his father and loyalty to his friend. When have you been stuck between competing loyalties?</li>
        <li>Saul told Jonathan that David was a threat to Jonathan's future. Jonathan didn't buy it. How do you recognize when someone is trying to turn you against a person you should trust?</li>
        <li>Their friendship required secret meetings, signals, and risk. Real loyalty sometimes isn't convenient. What has genuine friendship cost you?</li>
        <li>Do you have someone who would sacrifice something for you? Are you that kind of friend to anyone?</li>
