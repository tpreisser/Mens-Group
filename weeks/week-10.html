        <li>David had the opportunity to take what was rightfully his by force. When have you been tempted to take a shortcut to something you knew was eventually coming?</li>
        <li>David felt convicted just for cutting Saul's robe—even though Saul was trying to kill him. What does that level of integrity reveal about how David saw authority?</li>
        <li>Saul wept, acknowledged David was right, and then went back to hunting him later. When has doing the right thing not changed your circumstances?</li>
        <li>David had been anointed as a teenager but didn't become king until he was 30. What does it take to stay faithful when the timeline doesn't make sense?</li>
        <li>"I won't touch the Lord's anointed." What boundaries have you set for yourself even when breaking them would be easier?</li>
