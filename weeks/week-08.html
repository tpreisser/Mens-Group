        <li>Elijah gave the same answer before and after the wind, earthquake, and fire. What's a script or narrative you keep running in your head that nothing seems to change?</li>
        <li>God wasn't in the dramatic stuff—the wind, earthquake, or fire. He was in the whisper. What makes the quiet harder to listen to than the dramatic?</li>
        <li>Elijah was doing the right things—he walked to the holy mountain, he went to the cave, he showed up. When have you been going through the motions without anything getting through?</li>
        <li>God's response was practical: go do these specific tasks, and here's someone to share the load. What would that look like for you right now?</li>
        <li>"I alone am left" wasn't true—there were 7,000 others. What's a false belief about your situation that you've been treating as fact?</li>
